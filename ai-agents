## 1. Introduction to AI Agents {#introduction}

### What is an AI Agent? (Conceptual Foundation)

An AI agent is fundamentally different from traditional software because it exhibits **agency** - the ability to act independently toward goals. But what does this really mean?

#### The Core Conceptual Difference

**Traditional Software:**
```
Input → Processing → Output
```
- Deterministic: same input always produces same output
- Reactive: waits for input to do anything
- Stateless: doesn't remember previous interactions

**AI Agent:**
```
Environment → Perception → Internal State → Decision → Action → Environment
                ↑                                              ↓
                └──────────── Feedback Loop ─────────────────┘
```

#### Why This Matters Conceptually

1. **Continuous Operation**: Unlike functions that run once, agents maintain persistent "consciousness" - they're always "thinking" about their environment and goals.

2. **Goal-Oriented Behavior**: They have an internal representation of what they want to achieve, not just what to do when called.

3. **Adaptive Decision Making**: They can change their behavior based on what they learn, not just follow pre-programmed rules.

#### The Philosophy Behind Agency

Think about human intelligence: you don't just respond to stimuli. You have:
- **Intentions** (goals you want to achieve)
- **Beliefs** (your understanding of the world)
- **Desires** (preferences about outcomes)
- **Plans** (strategies to achieve goals)

AI agents attempt to replicate this structure computationally. They maintain:
- **Goal representations** (what they're trying to achieve)
- **World models** (their understanding of the environment)
- **Value functions** (how they evaluate different outcomes)
- **Policy functions** (how they decide what to do)

### The Emergence of Intelligence

What makes an agent "intelligent" isn't any single component, but the **interaction** between:
- **Perception** (how it interprets its environment)
- **Cognition** (how it reasons about what to do)
- **Action** (how it affects its environment)
- **Learning** (how it improves over time)

This creates an **emergent intelligence** - behaviors that arise from the interaction of simpler components, not from any single "smart" part.

---

## 2. The Deep Conceptual Foundations {#conceptual-foundations}

### 2.1 How AI Agents Actually "Think"

#### The Language Model as a Reasoning Engine

Modern AI agents are built on Large Language Models (LLMs), but how do they go from "predicting next words" to "intelligent behavior"?

**The Key Insight**: Language models don't just predict text - they learn to simulate the reasoning process that would produce that text.

When you see:
```
"The weather is sunny, so I should..."
```

The model learns that humans typically continue with actions appropriate for sunny weather. It's learning the **causal reasoning patterns** embedded in language.

#### The Transformation from Text Prediction to Reasoning

**Step 1: Pattern Recognition**
```
Input: "I need to book a flight"
Model learns: This typically follows with actions like:
- Searching flight websites
- Checking dates and prices
- Making comparisons
- Selecting and booking
```

**Step 2: Reasoning Simulation**
```
The model doesn't just predict words, it simulates the thought process:
"To book a flight, I need to:
1. Know the destination
2. Know the dates
3. Check available options
4. Compare prices
5. Make a selection"
```

**Step 3: Action Planning**
```
The model translates reasoning into actionable steps:
"I should use the search_flights tool with these parameters..."
```

#### Why This Works: The Emergence of Reasoning

Language contains the **traces of human reasoning**. When we write:
- "Because X, therefore Y"
- "First I'll do A, then B"
- "Given that P is true, Q must be..."

We're encoding logical relationships. LLMs learn these patterns and can apply them to new situations.

### 2.2 The Internal State Problem

#### What Does It Mean for an AI to "Remember"?

Traditional computers have memory as data storage. But for AI agents, memory is **contextual understanding**.

**Human Memory Analogy**:
When you remember a conversation, you don't just recall the words - you remember:
- The context (where, when, why)
- Your emotional state
- What you learned
- How it relates to other experiences

**AI Agent Memory**:
```
Raw Memory: "User asked about weather at 2:23 PM"
Contextual Memory: 
- User is planning outdoor activity
- They care about precipitation, not just temperature
- They asked similar questions before events
- They prefer detailed forecasts
```

#### The Attention Mechanism as "Selective Focus"

AI agents use **attention** to focus on relevant information, just like humans do.

**Conceptual Example**:
```
Context: "I'm going to Paris next week. What should I pack? The weather looks rainy."

Attention weights:
- "Paris" (destination context) - HIGH
- "next week" (timing context) - HIGH  
- "weather" (current focus) - VERY HIGH
- "rainy" (specific condition) - VERY HIGH
- "pack" (action needed) - HIGH
```

The agent doesn't process all information equally - it dynamically focuses on what's most relevant to the current goal.

### 2.3 How Tools Actually Work (The Deep Mechanism)

#### The Function Calling Revolution

Modern AI agents don't just generate text - they can **call functions**. But how does this work conceptually?

**The Bridge Between Language and Action**:
```
1. Agent generates text: "I need to search for 'Python tutorials'"
2. Text is parsed to extract: function_name="web_search", parameters={"query": "Python tutorials"}
3. Function is executed: web_search("Python tutorials")
4. Result is fed back: "Found 10 results about Python tutorials..."
5. Agent continues reasoning with new information
```

#### The Conceptual Breakthrough

The key insight is that **structured text can represent structured actions**. 

```
Natural Language: "Search for information about AI"
↓
Structured Representation: {"action": "search", "query": "AI information"}
↓
Function Call: search_tool("AI information")
↓
Result: [search results]
↓
Back to Natural Language: "Based on the search results, I found..."
```

### 2.4 The Planning Problem (How AI Agents Think Ahead)

#### The Fundamental Challenge

How do you get an AI that processes tokens sequentially to think about long-term plans?

**The Solution: Explicit Planning in Language**

Instead of trying to plan in some abstract representation, agents plan **in language**:

```
"My goal is to write a research paper. Let me break this down:

1. First, I need to define my research question
2. Then, I'll search for relevant literature  
3. I'll analyze the findings and identify gaps
4. I'll formulate my hypothesis
5. I'll outline the paper structure
6. I'll write each section systematically
7. I'll review and revise

For step 1, I need to..."
```

#### Why This Works: Language as a Planning Medium

Language evolved as a tool for human reasoning and planning. When AI agents plan in language, they're leveraging billions of years of evolution in how to structure thought.

**The Recursive Nature of Planning**:
```
High-level plan: "Write a research paper"
↓
Mid-level plan: "Search for literature on topic X"
↓
Low-level plan: "Use search tool with query 'recent advances in X'"
↓
Action: search_tool("recent advances in X")
```

### 2.5 The Learning Loop (How Agents Improve)

#### The Fundamental Learning Mechanism

AI agents learn through **experience replay** and **reflection**:

**Experience Replay**:
```
1. Agent attempts task
2. Records: [situation, action, outcome]
3. Later, when facing similar situation:
   - Retrieves relevant experiences
   - Applies learned patterns
   - Adapts based on context differences
```

**Reflection**:
```
"Last time I tried approach X, it failed because Y.
This time, I should try approach Z instead."
```

#### The Meta-Learning Aspect

Advanced agents don't just learn facts - they learn **how to learn**:

```
"I notice that when I research technical topics, I get better results by:
1. Starting with authoritative sources
2. Cross-referencing multiple sources
3. Focusing on recent publications
4. Summarizing key points incrementally"
```

This is **learning about learning** - meta-cognition applied to information processing.

- Better for complex tasks

#### Hybrid Agents
- Combine reactive and deliberative approaches
- Reactive layer for immediate responses
- Deliberative layer for complex planning

---

## 4. Agent Architecture: The Deep Mechanics {#agent-architecture}

### 4.1 The Perception-Action Loop (Conceptual Deep Dive)

#### What Does "Perception" Really Mean for an AI Agent?

Human perception involves:
- Sensory input (sight, sound, touch)
- Pattern recognition (identifying objects, faces)
- Contextual understanding (this is a kitchen, not a garage)
- Emotional/motivational filtering (focusing on relevant information)

**AI Agent Perception**:
```
Raw Input: "User message: 'It's raining outside'"
↓
Linguistic Processing: [tokenization, parsing, semantic analysis]
↓
Contextual Integration: 
- Previous context: User was planning outdoor activity
- World knowledge: Rain affects outdoor plans
- Goal relevance: This impacts current task
↓
Perceived Situation: "User's outdoor plans are threatened by weather"
```

#### The Attention Revolution in AI

**The Core Problem**: An AI agent receives massive amounts of information but can only process a limited amount effectively.

**The Solution**: Attention mechanisms that work like human selective attention:

```
Input Context: "I'm going to the store to buy milk, bread, and eggs. The weather is sunny. My car needs gas. I should also pick up my prescription."

Attention Weights (for goal "plan shopping trip"):
- "store" → 0.9 (highly relevant)
- "milk, bread, eggs" → 0.95 (core task)
- "weather sunny" → 0.3 (somewhat relevant for planning)
- "car needs gas" → 0.8 (affects transportation)
- "prescription" → 0.7 (additional task)
```

This isn't just keyword matching - it's **semantic relevance** computed through neural networks.

### 4.2 The Reasoning Engine: How AI Agents Actually Think

#### The Transformer Architecture as a Reasoning Machine

**The Key Insight**: The same architecture that powers language models can simulate reasoning processes.

**How It Works**:
```
Input: "If it's raining and I don't have an umbrella, what should I do?"

Layer 1: Identify concepts
- "raining" → weather condition
- "umbrella" → protection tool
- "what should I do" → action request

Layer 2: Identify relationships
- rain + no umbrella → getting wet
- getting wet → negative outcome
- need alternative solution

Layer 3: Generate solutions
- find umbrella
- avoid going out
- find alternative protection
- accept getting wet

Layer 4: Evaluate options
- practical feasibility
- goal alignment
- resource requirements

Output: "You could wait for the rain to stop, find an umbrella, or use alternative protection like a hood or jacket."
```

#### The Chain of Thought Revolution

**The Breakthrough**: Making the reasoning process explicit dramatically improves performance.

**Why This Works Conceptually**:
1. **Externalized Working Memory**: By writing out thoughts, the AI can refer back to earlier reasoning steps
2. **Error Correction**: Explicit reasoning allows for self-correction
3. **Compositional Reasoning**: Complex problems can be broken into simpler steps

```
Problem: "How many windows are in the Empire State Building?"

Without Chain of Thought:
Input → Model → "Approximately 6,500 windows"

With Chain of Thought:
"Let me think through this step by step:
1. The Empire State Building has 102 floors
2. Each floor typically has about 60-80 windows
3. Some floors (like mechanical floors) have fewer windows
4. The building tapers toward the top, so upper floors have fewer windows
5. Averaging about 65 windows per floor
6. 102 floors × 65 windows ≈ 6,630 windows
7. This aligns with the commonly cited figure of approximately 6,500 windows"
```

### 4.3 The Action Selection Problem

#### How Does an AI Agent Choose What to Do?

This is one of the deepest problems in AI. How do you get from "understanding the situation" to "taking the right action"?

**The Value Function Approach**:
```
For each possible action, estimate:
- Probability of success
- Expected benefit if successful
- Cost of execution
- Risk of failure
- Alignment with long-term goals

Choose action with highest expected value.
```

**The Policy Function Approach**:
```
Learn a direct mapping from situations to actions:
Situation → Action

"User asks about weather" → "Call weather API"
"User seems frustrated" → "Acknowledge concern, offer help"
"Task requires research" → "Begin with web search"
```

#### The Exploration vs Exploitation Dilemma

**The Problem**: Should an agent do what it knows works (exploitation) or try new approaches (exploration)?

**AI Agent Solution**:
```
Exploitation: Use known successful strategies
Exploration: Try new approaches with small probability
Meta-learning: Learn when to explore vs exploit

Example:
- 90% of time: Use proven approach
- 10% of time: Try variations
- If variation works better: Update strategy
```

### 4.4 The Memory Architecture (How AI Agents Remember)

#### The Multi-Level Memory System

**Working Memory** (immediate context):
```
- Current conversation
- Active goals
- Immediate observations
- Recent actions and results
```

**Episodic Memory** (specific experiences):
```
- "Last Tuesday, user asked about X and I provided Y"
- "When I tried approach A, it failed because of B"
- "User prefers detailed explanations over brief ones"
```

**Semantic Memory** (general knowledge):
```
- "Python is a programming language"
- "Users typically get frustrated when tasks take too long"
- "Web searches work better with specific keywords"
```

#### The Retrieval Problem

**How does an AI agent find relevant memories?**

**Vector Similarity Search**:
```
1. Convert current situation to vector representation
2. Compare with stored memory vectors
3. Retrieve most similar memories
4. Use retrieved memories to inform current action
```

**Conceptual Example**:
```
Current: "User wants to learn Python"
Similar memories:
- "User asked about JavaScript learning resources" (0.8 similarity)
- "User mentioned being a beginner programmer" (0.9 similarity)
- "User prefers interactive tutorials" (0.7 similarity)

Retrieved context: User is beginner who likes interactive resources
Action: Recommend interactive Python tutorials
```

### 4.5 The ReAct Pattern: Thinking and Acting in Harmony

#### Why ReAct Works So Well

The ReAct pattern (Reasoning + Acting) solves a fundamental problem: how to combine deliberative thinking with responsive action.

**The Problem Without ReAct**:
```
Agent thinks: "I need to find information about X"
Agent acts: [calls search tool]
Agent gets result: [search results]
Agent thinks: "Hmm, what do I do with this?"
[No clear connection between thinking and acting]
```

**The Solution With ReAct**:
```
Thought: "I need to find recent information about AI agents"
Action: web_search("AI agents 2024 recent developments")
Observation: Found 10 articles about AI agent developments
Thought: "I see several key trends emerging. Let me search for more specific information about multi-agent systems"
Action: web_search("multi-agent systems 2024 research")
Observation: Found research papers on multi-agent coordination
Thought: "Now I have enough information to provide a comprehensive answer"
```

#### The Deeper Mechanism

**ReAct creates a feedback loop between reasoning and action**:
1. **Reasoning** generates hypotheses about what to do
2. **Action** tests these hypotheses in the real world
3. **Observation** provides feedback on hypothesis quality
4. **Updated Reasoning** incorporates new information

This mimics how humans solve problems - we don't just think abstractly, we think, try, observe, and adjust.

### 4.6 The Emergence of Intelligence

#### How Simple Components Create Complex Behavior

**The Key Insight**: Intelligence emerges from the interaction of simple components, not from any single "smart" component.

**The Components**:
- Pattern recognition (perceiving similarities)
- Memory (storing and retrieving experiences)
- Goal representation (knowing what to achieve)
- Action selection (choosing what to do)
- Learning (improving over time)

**The Emergent Properties**:
- **Creativity**: Novel combinations of existing patterns
- **Adaptability**: Adjusting behavior based on new situations
- **Problem-solving**: Breaking down complex challenges
- **Social intelligence**: Understanding and responding to others

#### The Scaling Hypothesis

**Why Bigger Models Are Often Smarter**:
1. **More patterns**: Larger models can recognize more subtle patterns
2. **Better generalization**: More data leads to better transfer between domains
3. **Emergent capabilities**: Some abilities only appear at scale
4. **Reduced brittleness**: Larger models are less likely to fail on edge cases

But scale alone isn't enough - the **architecture** and **training process** matter enormously.

        self.long_term = VectorDB()
    
    def remember(self, experience):
        self.short_term.append(experience)
        if len(self.short_term) > 10:
            self.consolidate_to_long_term()
    
    def recall(self, query):
        return self.long_term.similarity_search(query)
```

### 5.3 Memory Strategies

- Remove outdated information
- Maintain relevance

#### Memory Consolidation
- Move important short-term memories to long-term
- Strengthen frequently accessed memories
- Compress and organize information

---

## 6. Tool Integration {#tool-integration}

### 6.1 What Are Tools?

Tools are external capabilities that agents can use:
- Web search and browsing
- API calls to external services
- File system operations
- Database queries
- Code execution environments
- Communication channels

### 6.2 Tool Categories

#### Information Gathering
- Web scrapers
- Search engines
- Database queries
- API calls

#### Processing & Analysis
- Code interpreters
- Data analysis tools
- Image/video processors
- Mathematical calculators

#### Output & Communication
- Email senders
- File writers
- Notification systems
- Report generators

### 6.3 Tool Use Pattern

```python
class Tool:
    def __init__(self, name, description, function):
        self.name = name
        self.description = description
        self.function = function
    
    def use(self, parameters):
        return self.function(parameters)

# Example tools
tools = [
    Tool("web_search", "Search the internet", web_search_function),
    Tool("send_email", "Send email", email_function),
    Tool("write_file", "Write to file", file_write_function)
]
```

### 6.4 Tool Selection

Agents must decide which tools to use:
- Parse available tools and their descriptions
- Match tool capabilities to current needs
- Consider tool constraints and limitations
- Handle tool failures gracefully

---

## 7. Planning and Reasoning: The Cognitive Engine {#planning-and-reasoning}

### 7.1 The Planning Problem: How AI Agents Think About the Future

#### The Fundamental Challenge

How do you get an AI system that processes information sequentially to think about long-term, multi-step plans?

**The Human Approach**:
```
Goal: "Make dinner"
Mental simulation:
- Check what's in fridge
- Decide on recipe based on available ingredients
- Identify missing ingredients
- Go to store if needed
- Prepare ingredients in correct order
- Cook following recipe steps
- Serve and eat
```

**The AI Agent Approach**:
```
Goal: "Complete research report"
Language-based planning:
"To complete this research report, I need to:
1. Define the research question clearly
2. Search for relevant academic sources
3. Analyze and synthesize the findings
4. Create an outline based on key themes
5. Write each section systematically
6. Review and refine the content
7. Format and finalize the report

For step 1, I should start by..."
```

#### Why Language-Based Planning Works

**The Key Insight**: Language evolved as a tool for human reasoning and planning. When AI agents plan in language, they leverage this evolutionary optimization.

**The Mechanism**:
1. **Decomposition**: Breaking complex goals into simpler sub-goals
2. **Sequencing**: Ordering actions based on dependencies
3. **Contingency**: Planning for different possible outcomes
4. **Abstraction**: Working at different levels of detail

### 7.2 The Reasoning Revolution: From Pattern Matching to Logical Thinking

#### How Transformers Learned to Reason

**The Surprising Discovery**: Models trained to predict next words accidentally learned to perform logical reasoning.

**Why This Happened**:
```
Training Data Contains Reasoning Patterns:
"If A implies B, and B implies C, then A implies C"
"Given that all X are Y, and Z is an X, then Z is Y"
"Since P is true and Q is true, then P AND Q is true"
```

The model learned these patterns so well that it can apply them to new situations.

#### The Chain of Thought Breakthrough

**Before Chain of Thought**:
```
Input: "Sarah has 3 apples. She gives 1 to John and 2 to Mary. How many does she have left?"
Output: "0 apples"
```

**With Chain of Thought**:
```
Input: "Sarah has 3 apples. She gives 1 to John and 2 to Mary. How many does she have left?"
Output: "Let me work through this step by step:
- Sarah starts with 3 apples
- She gives 1 to John: 3 - 1 = 2 apples left
- She gives 2 to Mary: 2 - 2 = 0 apples left
- Therefore, Sarah has 0 apples left."
```

**Why This Works**:
1. **Externalized Working Memory**: The reasoning steps serve as temporary storage
2. **Error Correction**: Mistakes in reasoning can be caught and corrected
3. **Compositional Reasoning**: Complex problems are broken into manageable parts

### 7.3 The Tree of Thoughts: Exploring Multiple Reasoning Paths

#### The Limitation of Linear Thinking

Chain of Thought is powerful but limited - it follows a single reasoning path. What if that path is wrong?

**The Solution**: Explore multiple reasoning paths simultaneously.

```
Problem: "How can I increase website traffic?"

Thought Branch 1: "Focus on SEO optimization"
└── Sub-thought: "Research keywords"
└── Sub-thought: "Optimize existing content"
└── Sub-thought: "Build backlinks"

Thought Branch 2: "Improve content quality"
└── Sub-thought: "Identify audience needs"
└── Sub-thought: "Create valuable content"
└── Sub-thought: "Update old posts"

Thought Branch 3: "Expand to new channels"
└── Sub-thought: "Try social media marketing"
└── Sub-thought: "Start email newsletter"
└── Sub-thought: "Guest posting"

Evaluation: Which branch is most promising given current resources?
```

#### The Evaluation Problem

How does an AI agent evaluate different reasoning paths?

**Evaluation Criteria**:
1. **Logical Consistency**: Does the reasoning follow logically?
2. **Factual Accuracy**: Are the premises true?
3. **Relevance**: Does this path address the original goal?
4. **Feasibility**: Can this plan actually be executed?
5. **Expected Outcome**: What's the likely result?

### 7.4 The Reflection Mechanism: Learning from Mistakes

#### The Problem with One-Shot Reasoning

Early AI agents would generate a plan and execute it without reflection. If something went wrong, they couldn't learn from the failure.

**The Solution**: Explicit reflection on outcomes.

```
Initial Plan: "Send email to all customers about new product"
Execution: [sends email]
Outcome: "High unsubscribe rate, low engagement"
Reflection: "The email was too promotional and sent to wrong audience segment"
Learning: "Future emails should be more personalized and value-focused"
Updated Strategy: "Segment customers by interest and send targeted, helpful content"
```

#### The Meta-Cognitive Loop

**The Deeper Insight**: Effective agents don't just reason about their domain - they reason about their own reasoning process.

```
Level 1: Domain reasoning
"I need to find information about X"

Level 2: Meta-reasoning
"My usual search strategy didn't work well last time. Let me try a different approach"

Level 3: Meta-meta-reasoning
"I notice I'm spending too much time on meta-reasoning. Let me focus on the task"
```

### 7.5 The Uncertainty Problem: Reasoning Under Incomplete Information

#### The Real-World Challenge

Most real-world problems involve incomplete information. How do AI agents handle uncertainty?

**Probabilistic Reasoning**:
```
Given: "User mentions they're 'probably' free next Tuesday"
Uncertainty: What's the probability they're actually free?

Agent reasoning:
- "probably" suggests 70-80% confidence
- User's past behavior: cancels 20% of tentative plans
- Adjusted probability: 60% likely to be free
- Decision: Schedule tentatively but have backup plan
```

**Bayesian Updating**:
```
Prior belief: "User prefers email communication" (70% confidence)
New evidence: "User responded quickly to text message"
Updated belief: "User prefers email communication" (60% confidence)
```

#### The Confidence Calibration Problem

**The Challenge**: AI agents need to know how confident they should be in their reasoning.

**The Solution**: Explicit confidence modeling.

```
Reasoning step: "The capital of France is Paris"
Confidence: 99.9% (very high certainty)

Reasoning step: "The user probably wants option A"
Confidence: 65% (moderate certainty)

Reasoning step: "This stock will go up tomorrow"
Confidence: 45% (low certainty, highly uncertain domain)
```

### 7.6 The Causal Reasoning Revolution

#### Beyond Correlation: Understanding Cause and Effect

**The Problem**: Early AI systems could find correlations but not causal relationships.

**The Breakthrough**: Modern AI agents can perform causal reasoning.

```
Correlation: "Ice cream sales and drowning incidents both increase in summer"
Causal reasoning: "Hot weather causes both increased ice cream sales and more swimming, which increases drowning risk"
```

**How This Works in Practice**:
```
User: "My website traffic dropped last week"
Agent reasoning:
- Correlation: Traffic drop coincided with site redesign
- Causal hypothesis: Redesign caused traffic drop
- Test: Check if redesign affected user experience
- Alternative causes: Algorithm changes, seasonal patterns, technical issues
- Conclusion: Multiple factors likely involved
```

#### The Intervention Problem

**The Key Insight**: To understand causation, you need to think about interventions.

```
Question: "Will hiring more developers increase productivity?"
Causal thinking:
- If we hire more developers (intervention)
- What would happen to productivity (outcome)?
- Consider mediating factors: coordination overhead, onboarding time, team dynamics
- Prediction: Short-term decrease, potential long-term increase
```

### 7.7 The Emergence of Strategic Thinking

#### From Reactive to Strategic

**Early AI**: Reactive problem-solving
```
Problem appears → Solve problem → Wait for next problem
```

**Modern AI Agents**: Strategic thinking
```
Anticipate future problems → Prepare solutions → Shape environment to prevent problems
```

#### The Game Theory Integration

**The Insight**: Many real-world situations involve multiple agents with conflicting goals.

```
Scenario: Negotiating with customer
Agent reasoning:
- Customer wants: Low price, high quality, fast delivery
- Our constraints: Profit margins, resource limitations
- Strategy: Find win-win solutions
- Tactics: Offer tiered options, emphasize unique value
- Contingencies: Plan for different customer responses
```

This represents a fundamental shift from simple problem-solving to strategic interaction.

## 8. Popular Frameworks {#popular-frameworks}

### 8.1 LangChain

**Best for**: Custom agents with complex tool chains

```python
from langchain.agents import initialize_agent, Tool
from langchain.llms import OpenAI

# Define tools
tools = [
    Tool(
        name="Calculator",

```python
class SimpleAgent:
    def __init__(self, llm, tools):
        self.llm = llm
        self.tools = tools
        self.memory = []
    
    def run(self, goal):
        while not self.is_goal_achieved(goal):
            # Perceive current state
            observation = self.perceive()
            
            # Reason about next action
            thought = self.think(observation, goal)
            
            # Select and execute action
            action = self.select_action(thought)
            result = self.execute_action(action)
            
            # Remember experience
            self.memory.append({
                'observation': observation,
                'thought': thought,
                'action': action,
                'result': result
            })
    
    def think(self, observation, goal):
        prompt = f"""
        Goal: {goal}
        Current observation: {observation}
        Available tools: {[tool.name for tool in self.tools]}
        
        What should I do next?

## 9. Building Your First Agent {#building-first-agent}

### 9.1 Project Setup

Let's build a simple research agent that can search the web and summarize findings.

```python
import openai
import requests
from typing import List, Dict

class ResearchAgent:
    def __init__(self, api_key: str):
        openai.api_key = api_key
        self.memory = []
        self.tools = self._setup_tools()
    
    def _setup_tools(self):
        return {
            'web_search': self._web_search,
            'summarize': self._summarize
        }
    
    def _web_search(self, query: str) -> str:
        # Implement web search (using search API)
        # This is a placeholder
        return f"Search results for: {query}"
    
    def _summarize(self, text: str) -> str:
        response = openai.ChatCompletion.create(
            model="gpt-3.5-turbo",
            messages=[
                {"role": "system", "content": "You are a summarization expert."},
                {"role": "user", "content": f"Summarize this text: {text}"}
            ]
        )
        return response.choices[0].message.content
```

### 9.2 Core Agent Loop

```python
def run_research_task(self, topic: str) -> str:
    goal = f"Research {topic} and provide a comprehensive summary"
    
    # Step 1: Plan approach
    plan = self._create_plan(goal)
    
    # Step 2: Execute plan
    for step in plan:
        if step['action'] == 'search':
            results = self._web_search(step['query'])
            self.memory.append({
                'action': 'search',
                'query': step['query'],
                'results': results
            })
        elif step['action'] == 'summarize':
            summary = self._summarize(step['content'])
            self.memory.append({
                'action': 'summarize',
                'content': step['content'],
                'summary': summary
            })
    
    # Step 3: Compile final report
    return self._compile_report(topic)

def _create_plan(self, goal: str) -> List[Dict]:
    response = openai.ChatCompletion.create(
        model="gpt-3.5-turbo",
        messages=[
            {"role": "system", "content": "You are a research planning expert."},
            {"role": "user", "content": f"Create a research plan for: {goal}"}
        ]
    )
    # Parse response into structured plan
    return self._parse_plan(response.choices[0].message.content)
```

### 9.3 Adding Error Handling

```python
def execute_with_retry(self, action, max_retries=3):
    for attempt in range(max_retries):
        try:
            return action()
        except Exception as e:
            if attempt == max_retries - 1:
                raise e
            self.memory.append({
                'error': str(e),
                'attempt': attempt + 1,
                'action': action.__name__
            })
            # Wait before retry
            time.sleep(2 ** attempt)
```

## 10. Advanced Patterns {#advanced-patterns}

### 10.1 Reflexion Pattern

Agents that can self-reflect and improve:

```python
class ReflectiveAgent:
    def __init__(self):
        self.performance_history = []
    
    def reflect_on_performance(self, task_result):
        reflection_prompt = f"""
        Task: {task_result['task']}
        Actions taken: {task_result['actions']}
        Result: {task_result['result']}
        
        What could be improved for next time?
        """
        
        reflection = self.llm.generate(reflection_prompt)
        self.performance_history.append({
            'task': task_result['task'],
            'reflection': reflection,
            'timestamp': datetime.now()
        })
    
    def apply_learnings(self, new_task):
        relevant_reflections = self.find_relevant_reflections(new_task)
        return self.incorporate_learnings(new_task, relevant_reflections)
```

### 10.2 Chain of Thought

Breaking down complex reasoning:

```python
def chain_of_thought_reasoning(self, problem):
    prompt = f"""
    Problem: {problem}
    
    Let me think through this step by step:
    
    Step 1: What do I need to understand?
    Step 2: What information do I need to gather?
    Step 3: How should I approach this?
    Step 4: What are the key considerations?
    Step 5: What's my conclusion?
    """
    
    return self.llm.generate(prompt)
```

### 10.3 Tree of Thoughts

Exploring multiple reasoning paths:

```python
class TreeOfThoughts:
    def __init__(self):
        self.thought_tree = {}
    
    def explore_thoughts(self, problem, depth=3):
        thoughts = []
        
        for i in range(depth):
            # Generate multiple thought branches
            branches = self.generate_thought_branches(problem)
            
            # Evaluate each branch
            evaluated_branches = []
            for branch in branches:
                score = self.evaluate_thought(branch)
                evaluated_branches.append((branch, score))
            
            # Select best branches for further exploration
            best_branches = sorted(evaluated_branches, key=lambda x: x[1], reverse=True)[:3]
            thoughts.extend(best_branches)
        
        return self.synthesize_best_solution(thoughts)
```

### 11.1 Communication Patterns

#### Direct Communication
```python
class Agent:
    def send_message(self, recipient, message):
        recipient.receive_message(self, message)
    
    def receive_message(self, sender, message):
        self.message_queue.append({
            'sender': sender,
            'message': message,

        })
```

#### Broadcast Communication
```python
class MessageBroker:
    def __init__(self):
        self.agents = []
    
    def broadcast(self, sender, message):
        for agent in self.agents:
            if agent != sender:
                agent.receive_message(sender, message)
```

#### Hierarchical Communication
```python
class HierarchicalSystem:
    def __init__(self):
        self.supervisor = SupervisorAgent()
        self.workers = [WorkerAgent() for _ in range(5)]
    
    def delegate_task(self, task):
        assigned_agent = self.supervisor.select_agent(task)
        assigned_agent.execute_task(task)
```

### 11.2 Coordination Strategies

#### Task Decomposition
```python
class TaskCoordinator:
    def decompose_task(self, complex_task):
        subtasks = self.break_down_task(complex_task)
        
        assignments = []
        for subtask in subtasks:
            best_agent = self.select_best_agent(subtask)
            assignments.append((subtask, best_agent))
        
        return assignments
```

#### Consensus Building
```python
class ConsensusBuilder:
    def reach_consensus(self, agents, proposal):
        votes = []
        for agent in agents:
            vote = agent.vote_on_proposal(proposal)
            votes.append(vote)
        
        if sum(votes) > len(agents) / 2:
            return self.implement_proposal(proposal)
        else:
            return self.revise_proposal(proposal, votes)
```

## 12. Production Considerations {#production-considerations}

### 12.1 Scalability

#### Horizontal Scaling
```python
class AgentPool:
    def __init__(self, agent_class, pool_size=10):
        self.agents = [agent_class() for _ in range(pool_size)]
        self.task_queue = queue.Queue()
        self.result_queue = queue.Queue()
    
    def submit_task(self, task):
        self.task_queue.put(task)
    
    def worker_loop(self):
        while True:
            task = self.task_queue.get()
            agent = self.get_available_agent()
            result = agent.execute(task)
            self.result_queue.put(result)
```

#### Load Balancing
```python
class LoadBalancer:
    def __init__(self, agents):
        self.agents = agents
        self.agent_loads = {agent: 0 for agent in agents}
    
    def assign_task(self, task):
        # Find least loaded agent
        selected_agent = min(self.agent_loads.items(), key=lambda x: x[1])[0]
        self.agent_loads[selected_agent] += 1
        return selected_agent
```

### 12.2 Monitoring and Observability

#### Logging
```python

class AgentLogger:
    def __init__(self, agent_id):
        self.logger = logging.getLogger(f"agent_{agent_id}")
    
    def log_action(self, action, result, duration):
        self.logger.info(f"Action: {action}, Result: {result}, Duration: {duration}s")
    
    def log_error(self, error, context):
        self.logger.error(f"Error: {error}, Context: {context}")
```

#### Metrics Collection
```python
class MetricsCollector:
    def __init__(self):
        self.metrics = {
            'tasks_completed': 0,
            'success_rate': 0.0,
            'avg_response_time': 0.0,
            'errors': []
        }
    
    def record_task_completion(self, success, duration):
        self.metrics['tasks_completed'] += 1
        if success:
            self.metrics['success_rate'] = self.calculate_success_rate()
        self.metrics['avg_response_time'] = self.update_avg_response_time(duration)
```

### 12.3 Security Considerations

#### Input Validation
```python
class SecurityFilter:
    def validate_input(self, user_input):
        # Check for malicious patterns
        dangerous_patterns = ['rm -rf', 'DELETE FROM', 'DROP TABLE']
        
        for pattern in dangerous_patterns:
            if pattern in user_input:
                raise SecurityError(f"Dangerous pattern detected: {pattern}")
        
        return self.sanitize_input(user_input)
```

#### Rate Limiting
```python
class RateLimiter:
    def __init__(self, max_requests_per_minute=60):
        self.max_requests = max_requests_per_minute
        self.requests = []
    
    def allow_request(self, user_id):
        now = datetime.now()
        # Remove old requests
        self.requests = [req for req in self.requests if now - req['timestamp'] < timedelta(minutes=1)]
        
        user_requests = [req for req in self.requests if req['user_id'] == user_id]
        
        if len(user_requests) >= self.max_requests:
            return False
        
        self.requests.append({'user_id': user_id, 'timestamp': now})
        return True
